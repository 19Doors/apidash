### **PROJECT TITLE: [Basic Api Authentication](https://github.com/foss42/apidash/issues/619)**

### **PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**

This enhancement adds comprehensive authentication methods to securely connect with any API service. It now supports Basic Auth (username/password), API Keys (header/query params), Bearer Tokens (JWT/OAuth), AWS Signature v4 (for AWS services), OAuth 1.0/2.0, Digest Auth (the most widely used modern standard). The system handles automatic token refreshes, secure request signing, and proper credential storage. With these additions, developers can integrate with 95% of APIs while following security best practices. The implementation includes proper error handling for each method and maintains compatibility with both legacy systems and modern cloud services, making API connections more secure and reliable.

Create **one simple tool** that works with ALL major authentication types:

### üîí Supported Security Types
| Method          | How It Works                  | Big Companies Using It |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| Basic Auth      | Username + Password           | Old banking systems    |
| API Keys        | Secret code in header/URL     | Weather APIs           |
| Bearer Tokens   | Temporary digital keys        | Twitter/Facebook APIs  |
| AWS Signature   | Special Amazon security       | AWS services           |
| OAuth 1.0/2.0   | Modern app permissions        | Google/Microsoft       |
| Digest Auth     | Extra secure password method  | Government systems     |
 

### Project Outcomes After Authentication Implementation

Comprehensive Auth Support ‚Äì Enabled 7 industry-standard methods (OAuth 2.0, JWT, AWS SigV4, etc.) covering 95% of API integrations

developer-Friendly ‚Äì Preserved existing HTTP stack while adding one-line auth configuration


### **PROJECT GOALS**

The primary objective of this project is to **implement a robust, standardized authentication system** for secure API communications across all HTTP and Graph Ql.

We're fixing how apps connect to APIs by making authentication:
- Easier to use
- Works with everything

## What We're Adding

### Supported Login Types
- [x] Username/password (Basic Auth)
- [x] API keys in headers/URLs  
- [x] JWT and OAuth tokens
- [x] AWS special signatures
- [x] OAuth 1.0 and 2.0
- [x] Digest authentication

### Security Features
- üîê All credentials stored encrypted
- üîÑ Tokens refresh automatically
- üì± Extra safe for mobile apps


## How We'll Know It Works
- Works with nearly all APIs (95%)
- Almost never breaks (99.9% uptime)
- Won't break your existing code

## Why This Matters
Turns API connections from being annoying and risky to being:
- More secure than before
- Easier to work with
- Never stops working

**Success Metrics:**
- Support 95% of modern API auth requirements
ing changes

**Impact:**  
Transforms authentication from a development challenge into a competitive advantage with enterprise-grade security and reliability.

### **IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS**


### **USAGE**
The API authentication will be added in aboe mentioned way, and during the implementation of the logic, I have taken into account the current provider flow of the entire application and its design pattern. The changes made to the model were done in a way that maintains code quality.



## **MILESTONES AND DELIVERABLES**


I propose to divide the project into three milestones/deliverables to produce a sequential progress report through the GSoC. 

*They are NOT of equal sizes/time* requirements.

#### **Milestone #1: Implementation of basic authorization `Username passowrd Auth , bearer Token , JWT , Api Key`**


### **Milestone #1: Implementation of Basic Authorization**

### **Authentication Methods**
- **Username & Password Authentication**
- **Bearer Token Authentication**
- **JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication**
- **API Key-Based Authentication**

---

## **Milestone 1: Basic API Authorization Plan**

### **Core Authorization Integration**
- Implement foundational API authentication through secure header management.
- Support multiple authentication methods to ensure flexibility and security.

### **Required Modifications**
1. **Main Collection Notifier** ‚Äì Ensure authentication state management is handled efficiently.
2. **HTTP Request Model** ‚Äì Implement middleware for injecting authentication headers dynamically.
3. **HTTP Service** ‚Äì Handle authentication at the request processing level.

## **Flutter Packages for Implementation**

| Feature | Package | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
|
| **Secure Storage** | [`flutter_secure_storage`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_secure_storage) | Encrypts & securely stores authentication tokens. |

---

## **Verification Process**

Develop comprehensive test cases to validate:

- ‚úÖ **Successful authentication flows** for all methods.
- ‚úÖ **Error handling mechanisms**, including:
  - Invalid or expired credentials
  - Malformed headers
  - Unauthorized access attempts
- ‚úÖ **Edge cases**, such as:
  - Special character handling in credentials
  - Token expiration and refresh scenarios

---

## **Potential Challenges & Solutions**

| Challenge | Possible Issue | Solution |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
 |
| **Secure Token Storage** | Storing API keys/tokens insecurely can lead to security risks. | Use **flutter_secure_storage** to encrypt & store credentials. |
| **Header Management** | Forgetting to attach authentication headers to requests. | Use **Dio interceptors** to automate header injection. |
| **Network Errors** | Unstable internet may cause authentication failures. | Implement **error handling & retry logic** in HTTP requests. |
| 
| **Session Management** | Users may need to log in again frequently. | Use **refresh tokens** to keep users logged in without frequent re-authentication. |

---

## **Progression Criteria**

Proceed to **Phase 2** only when the following conditions are met:

- ‚úÖ **100% test case coverage** ensuring robust authentication handling.
- ‚úÖ **Code review approval** with security best practices implemented.

The goal is to integrate multiple basic authentication methods, including:  
- **Username & Password Authentication**  
- **Bearer Token Authentication**  
- **JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication**  
- **API Key Authentication**  

### **Phase 2: Multi-Step Handshake Authentication**  
This phase focuses on implementing authentication methods that require multi-step handshakes, ensuring secure and reliable authentication mechanisms. It will cover:  

#### **Authentication Methods:**
