## Motivation & Experience

**FOSS Contributions:**  
Iâ€™ve been actively contributing to APIDash, submitting multiple PRs and raising issues. I have studied the codebase in depth and will begin implementation immediately after the initial discussions with mentors.

**Proudest Achievement:**  
Leading a college hackathon team to build an API client under a strict deadline. This experience strengthened my problem-solving skills and ability to work efficiently under pressure.

**Interest in APIDash:**  
I love how APIDash is fully built in Flutter, and I see a lot of potential in enhancing its authentication support and code generation features.

**Time Commitment:**  
I will be working on GSoC full-time, dedicating 7+ hours per day, especially in the early stages, to ensure smooth progress.

## Project Proposal

### **Title:** Adding Authentication Support & Enhance Code Generation feature in APIDash  

### **Abstract:**  
This project aims to expand APIDash by implementing multiple authentication methods (Basic Auth, OAuth 2.0, JWT, Digest Auth, API Keys) and improving its code generation capabilities. With prior experience in the codebase, I have already mapped out the necessary changes and will begin work right after mentor discussions.
